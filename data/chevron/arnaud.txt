The complete data is in /arnaud/CHEVRON/chevron/data/chevrondata
This file contains the two well datasets (Vave = 2000 m/s and 2300 m/s)
followed by the two corresponding seismic datasets for the same Vave.

The file is in GOCAD ASCII format. Unless you want to use GOCAD to view
the datasets, you can ignore and/or remove all the lines starting with
TRGL. The coordinate information is coded in the lines starting with VRTX
with the following pattern:

	VRTX  vertex_number  X  Y  Z

Let me know if you have any question about the geometry of the dataset.
Not all the wells fall inside the boundary of the "seismic" dataset.
